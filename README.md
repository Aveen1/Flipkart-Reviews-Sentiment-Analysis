# Flipkart-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

Flipkart is a well-known Indian company that operates as an e-commerce platform and competes with other popular e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. 
Among the various applications of data science, one of the most frequently employed is sentiment analysis of product reviews that are available on e-commerce platforms.
Dataset used in this project is downloaded from Kaggle. I did sentiment analysis on Flipkart reviews, then add three columns as Positive, Negative and Neutral to analyze the sentiment scores.
